# CAT OR DOG

In the spirit of learning more about deep learning, I've trained a model on spotting either a cat or a dog.

It's wild to me that this would not have been possible just 5-10 years ago (or at least not without a whole team/large company's resources behind it).

I trained this while sitting in a bakery while drinking an afternoon's cup of coffee. Wild.
